## Objective 🎯

The main objective of this project is to analyze and visualize shark attack data to gain insights into patterns and trends. 📊

## Functionality ⚙️

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Process raw data to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Create visual representations of the data to identify trends and patterns.
- 📝 **Reporting**: Generate summary reports and figures to present findings.

## Tools Used 🛠️

- 🐍 **Python**: Main programming language used for data processing and analysis.
- 🐼 **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive environment for data cleaning and visualization.
- 🌐 **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes and collaboration.

## Development Process 🚀

1. 📥 **Data Collection**: Gather raw data.
2. 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Use Jupyter Notebooks to clean and preprocess the data.
3. 🔍 **Data Analysis**: Analyze the cleaned data to extract meaningful insights.
4. 📊 **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to represent the data findings.
5. 📝 **Reporting**: Compile the results into summary reports and presentations.

## Results 📊

The analysis revealed several interesting patterns in shark attack data, including:
- 📅 Seasonal trends in shark attacks.
- 🌍 Geographic hotspots for shark activity.
- 🌦️ Correlation between shark attacks and environmental factors.
